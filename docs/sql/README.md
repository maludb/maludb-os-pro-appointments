# SQL files

**To install, load only these three, in order:**

1. `pg_schema.sql`: the complete PostgreSQL schema (61 tables)
2. `nav_permissions.sql`: sidebar visibility per role and business type (PostgreSQL; safe to re-run)
3. `os_adoption.sql`: the changes made while adopting the application into the MaluDB Business OS, the
   invitation code included (safe to re-run; also the upgrade for an existing install)

Every other file here is a historical migration from the MySQL era, kept for reference (`history/` holds the
MySQL sidebar seed this `nav_permissions.sql` was converted from). They are already folded into
`pg_schema.sql`, and several are MySQL syntax that fails on PostgreSQL. Do not load them on a new install.
